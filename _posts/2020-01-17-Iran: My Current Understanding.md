# Iran 
Though I'm of Iranian descent, I've largely avoided immersing myself in Iranian culture or making an effort to understand Persia's long and complicated history. With the recent murder of Iranian protestors by the Iranian regime and, more importantly, Trump's assassination of General Soleimani, it's about time I try to understand what the hell is going on here. This will at least be an introduction to my understanding of the geopolitical mess that is the Middle East and how we got there. Of note, I've really enjoyed following the news with the unprecedented amount of free time I've had in the last few weeks - I really wish I had more of a chance to do this, and I'm sad that the time restraints of residency will prevent me from being as knowledgeable as I could be. History is important, and I'm disappointed in myself for neglecting it in my earlier education. It's time for me to catch up.
