# Meditation and Mindfulness: A Brief Primer 
I find that when I'm trying to talk about meditation/mindfulness to others, I run into the problem of finding the right vocabulary. It's really easy to use imprecise language, especially when you're not an expert in the subject matter that's being discussed. This post is a sort of FAQ where I try to concisely, but precisely, respond to the many questions I hear about meditation/mindfulness. This is actually part of a larger self-improvement endeavour to improve my communication skills - not just in writing, but also as a speaker. Hopefully I make some headway in both of these goals. 

##FAQ

##1: What is meditation? What is mindfulness? How are they different? 
Meditation refers to a set of practices which train attention and awareness to achieve either a specific mindstate or quality of mind. There's such a large variety of traditions that it's challenging to arrive at an all-encompassing definition of "meditation," in the same way it's difficult to define "life" or a "planet" or a "sport." But at its heart, meditation is about training attention and awareness, usually resulting in a calm and stable state. 

Mindfulnes refers to a quality of mind. In the same way that you can say someone is "trustworthy" or "intelligent" or has strong "leadership" qualities, you can say that someone is "mindful." The practice of mindfulness involves purposefully being aware of the sensations, feelings, and thoughts one is experiencing in the present moment without judgment. Thus, when you say someone is "mindful," you are implying that they are self-aware about their experience in the present moment - whether it be an awareness about the sensation of their feet against the floor, the feeling of anxiety in their bones, or the planning that they're doing to finish all their work on time today. 


##2: Why should anyone meditate? 

This is a good question, and it's hard to answer. 

##3: What are the risks of meditation? What do you lose in the process of meditating? 

##4: What has been your personal experience with meditation and retreats? What have you learned? How have you changed?
